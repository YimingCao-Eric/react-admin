# React Admin Dashboard

A modern, responsive React-based admin dashboard frontend for managing an e-commerce platform. Built with TypeScript, Redux for state management, and React Router for navigation. This frontend provides a comprehensive interface for user management, role-based access control, product management, order processing, and analytics visualization. The codebase follows (and extends) lessons from the course [React and Golang: A Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-go-admin/).

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14.0 or higher)
- **npm** (version 6.0 or higher) or **yarn**
- **Backend API** running (see [go-admin](https://github.com/YimingCao-Eric/go-admin) for backend setup)

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd react-admin
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure API endpoint**
   
   The API base URL is configured in `src/index.tsx`. By default, it's set to:
   ```typescript
   axios.defaults.baseURL = 'http://localhost:8000/api/';
   ```
   
   Update this if your backend is running on a different URL or port.

4. **Start the backend server**
   
   Make sure the backend API is running. See the [backend repository](https://github.com/YimingCao-Eric/go-admin) for setup instructions.

## 🏃 Running the Application

1. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

2. **Open your browser**
   
   The application will automatically open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

3. **Login**
   
   - If you don't have an account, register at `/register`
   - Login with your credentials at `/login`
   - After successful login, you'll be redirected to the dashboard

## 🔌 API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API at `http://localhost:8000/api/`. Key integration points:

### Authentication
- **Login**: `POST /api/login` - Authenticates user and receives JWT token in HTTP-only cookie
- **Register**: `POST /api/register` - Creates new user account
- **Logout**: `POST /api/logout` - Clears authentication cookie
- **Get User**: `GET /api/user` - Fetches current authenticated user

### Data Fetching
- All API requests use `axios` with credentials enabled for cookie-based authentication
- Pagination is handled via query parameters: `?page=1`
- Error handling is implemented for failed requests

### State Management
- **Redux**: Used for managing authenticated user state globally
- User information is stored in Redux store and accessible throughout the app

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React 19**: UI library
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Redux**: State management
- **React Router**: Client-side routing
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API requests
- **C3.js / D3.js**: Charting library for data visualization
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for styling
- **Create React App**: Build tooling and development environment

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. **Login/Register**: User authenticates via login or registration form
2. **Token Storage**: JWT token is stored in HTTP-only cookie by the backend
3. **Protected Routes**: `Wrapper` component checks authentication on mount
4. **Auto-redirect**: Unauthenticated users are redirected to login page
5. **State Management**: Authenticated user data is stored in Redux store

## 🎨 Key Components

### Wrapper Component
- Provides layout structure (Nav + Menu + Content)
- Handles authentication checking
- Redirects to login if unauthorized
- Shows loading state during auth check

### ImageUpload Component
- Handles file selection and upload
- Integrates with backend upload endpoint
- Updates form fields with uploaded image URL

### Paginator Component
- Provides Previous/Next navigation
- Prevents navigation beyond first/last page
- Used across list pages (Users, Products, Orders)

## 🔄 Backend Integration

This frontend is designed to work seamlessly with the [go-admin](https://github.com/YimingCao-Eric/go-admin) backend:

- **CORS**: Backend configured to accept requests from `http://localhost:3000`
- **Cookies**: JWT tokens transmitted via HTTP-only cookies
- **API Endpoints**: All endpoints match backend route definitions
- **Error Handling**: Frontend handles backend error responses gracefully

## 📝 Development Notes

- **TypeScript**: All components are written in TypeScript for type safety
- **Comments**: Codebase includes comprehensive JSDoc-style comments
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks and error states implemented throughout
- **Loading States**: Loading indicators shown during async operations
- **Form Validation**: HTML5 validation and custom validation where needed

## 🚀 Deployment

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder. You can serve this with any static file server:

```bash
# Using serve
npx serve -s build

# Using Node.js
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

For production deployment:
1. Update the API base URL in `src/index.tsx` to point to your production backend
2. Build the application: `npm run build`
3. Deploy the `build` folder to your hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, etc.)
